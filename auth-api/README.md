# Authentication API

This part of the exercise is responsible for the users authentication.
- `POST /login` - takes a JSON and returns an access token

The JSON structure is:
```json
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin",
}
```

## Configuration

The service scans environment for variables:
- `AUTH_API_PORT` - the port the service takes.
- `USERS_API_ADDRESS` - base URL of [Users API](/users-api).
- `JWT_SECRET` - secret value for JWT token processing. Must be the same amongst all components.

## Initial data
Following users are hardcoded for you:

|  Username | Password  |
|-----------|-----------|
| admin     | admin     |
| johnd     | foo       |
| janed     | ddd       |

## Building

```
- export GO111MODULE=on
- go mod init github.com/bortizf/microservice-app-example/tree/master/auth-api
- go mod tidy
- go build
```

## Running
```
 JWT_SECRET=PRFT AUTH_API_PORT=8000 USERS_API_ADDRESS=http://127.0.0.1:8083 ./auth-api
```

## Usage
In case you need to test this API, you can use it as follows:
```
 curl -X POST  http://127.0.0.1:8000/login -d '{"username": "admin","password": "admin"}'
```
